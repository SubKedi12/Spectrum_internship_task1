# Spectrum_internship_task1
The repo contains my submission of completed task 1 for spectrum internship 2020.
I have submitted a presentation file too, to give a clear picture and also added a few cnclusions.
The files "Welcome.m", "Measurements.m" and "Condition.m" are for GUI using 'menu()' function.
The files "BMICalculator.m" and "Conditions.m" are for GUI without using 'menu()' function.
